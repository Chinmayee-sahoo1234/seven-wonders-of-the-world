          The Great Wall of China, spanning over 13,000 miles, is an ancient
          marvel of architecture and defense. Built over several centuries by
          various Chinese dynasties, it served as a formidable barrier against
          invasions from nomadic tribes. Originally constructed of stone, brick,
          tamped earth, and other materials, its purpose was to protect Chinese
          states and empires from raids and incursions. Parts of the wall are
          remarkably well-preserved, offering visitors a glimpse into China's
          rich history and engineering prowess. Today, it stands as one of the
          most iconic symbols of Chinese civilization and is a UNESCO World
          Heritage site drawing millions of tourists annually.
