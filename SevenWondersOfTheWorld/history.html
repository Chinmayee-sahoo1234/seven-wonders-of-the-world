            <p>
              A creation that serves as one of the largest archives of historical
              documents and a morgue, the Great Wall of China has gone far beyond
              its original purpose as just a defensive measure. Let's unpack that:
              because it was in construction for nearly 2,000 years by separate
              dynasties, inscriptions, and corpses are carved and buried onto and
              into this megalithic icon. Furthermore, tourist hype forced Chinese
              authorities to implement a daily limit of 65,000 visitors in places
              like the Badaling section of the Great Wall. It is hard to estimate
              the total annual visitors due to it being 5,500 miles (8,851 km)
              long, but around 150 million inbound tourists visit Beijing each
              year, and travel bloggers frequently claim that almost all tourists
              visiting Beijing are planning to check out the wall. In ancient
              times, foreign visitors were the antithesis of the wall's purpose
              because it was designed to prevent invasions by northern tribes,
              although it occasionally failed, like when Ghengis Khan overran it
              in 1214 CE with his nomadic army. Sadly, many stretches of the wall
              have vanished because of erosion and human disturbance. It also has
              a history as a form of border control for the Silk Road era, and it
              expedited the transmission of information from one region to
              another. Also, emperors would frequently expand or reinforce it as a
              demonstration of their dynasty's power and wealth. Despite popular
              belief, the wall is not visible from space, but it is visible in
              person; this is all the more reason to book a flight and check it
              out.

              This site is a golden example to prove that Egyptians were not the
              only ones capable of constructing enormous pyramids. The largest
              structure, El Castillo, is 98 feet and utilizes 365 stone steps to
              represent the solar year. The Maya people went beyond just sheer
              scale: during the equinoxes, a mystical shadow appears due to
              ingenious engineering, and a serpent's shadow appears to slither
              down the staircase. Naturally, this attention to detail means that
              the whole area was a religious, political, and economic center for
              the Mayan civilization that seems to have vanished overnight,
              abandoning all settlements by 900 CE. Stone tools were enough to
              create this 5 km2 complex, which is one of the reasons it fits as a
              UNESCO World Heritage site. Astronomy and acoustics were common
              sciences in this city, which is fitted with an ancient observatory,
              and whispers at one end of the Ball Court can be heard 135 meters
              away at the other end. Human sacrifices were performed here, but
              thankfully, its 3 million yearly visitors will not have to witness
              those extinct practices.

              "This is impossible" is a common thought for those who stand beneath
              the carved red-rock mountains in Petra. Yet, there it is. This
              ancient trading hub is larger than any painting or picture can
              capture, which is a reality that its one million annual visitors can
              understand. The buildings, sculpted straight out of the canyon
              walls, would have been endangered by sudden flash floods, but the
              Nabateans (a wealthy arab kingdom) designed a complex water control
              system to manage this. Due to the desert climate, they even
              installed an intricate series of dams, canals, and reservoirs into
              the rock faces to maintain a consistent water supply for 20,000
              inhabitants. Those grooves still exist in the rock walls today,
              collecting moisture the same way as they did two thousand years ago.
              Additionally, a legend once existed regarding a carved urn in the
              Treasury facade: Bedouin sharpshooters left bullet holes across it
              hundreds of years ago, believing that it held priceless riches
              within. The original occupants were also religious, and several of
              the carved buildings, like the Monastery and High Place of
              Sacrifice, were designed for ritual. More recently, the abandoned
              city has been the site of films like Indiana Jones and the Last
              Crusade. If you stumble across the complex today, a group of
              resilient people still reside in the carved homes, peddling crafts
              and offering rides on camels and horses.

          <div class="history-card-content">
            <p>
              Can you imagine the astonishment of those who discovered this
              metropolis, seemingly floating on clouds between mountains? The
              Machu Picchu, perched high in the Andes Mountains of Peru, is a
              stone's throw from Cuzco. Although it was well known to the local
              people, the West took note of it in 1911 when it was spotted by the
              American explorer Hiram Bingham. It was initially believed to be
              Vilcabamba, a hidden Incan haven during the Spanish resistance. The
              genuine intent behind this 15th-century structure, however, remains
              debated, with suggestions that it served as a sanctuary for the
              revered 'Virgins of the Sun,' a place of worship, or perhaps a regal
              escape. Notwithstanding its remote and towering position, travelers
              can step back in time amidst meticulously preserved Incan edifices
              showcasing farming terraces, open squares, living quarters, and
              skillfully designed shrines. Erected around 1450 as an imperial
              commission under Inca ruler Pachacuti, the site mesmerizes onlookers
              with its smooth, dry-stone construction and breathtaking vistas of
              the encompassing valley.

              The Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro is an awe-inspiring
              symbol of both faith and architectural brilliance. Overlooking the
              city from atop Mount Corcovado, this religious icon is visited by
              almost 2 million people per year. Initiated in the period following
              World War I, its creation from 1926 to 1931 was a collective
              endeavor involving Heitor da Silva Costa, Carlos Oswald, and Paul
              Landowski. With a striking height of 98 feet and its arms reaching
              92 feet wide, it's a marvel to behold. The base further elevates its
              grandeur by 26 feet. Made of reinforced concrete and embellished
              with over six million tiles, this statue is recognized as the
              world's most prominent Art Deco figure. Despite weather challenges,
              like lightning strikes, it remains steadfast, only once suffering
              damage to Jesus's right thumb in 2014. From almost any location in
              Rio, its silhouette can be discerned, providing incredible views and
              drawing both believers and admirers. Its significance and beauty
              rightfully earn it a place among the world's most revered landmarks.

            <p>
              Emperors are addicted to cementing their legacy by constructing
              incredible wonders, and the relationship between Emperor Vespasian
              and the Colosseum he commissioned is no different. The project was
              so grand that it was his son Titus' responsibility to complete it,
              and Emperor Domitian earned a little credit by making substantial
              modifications. Roman concrete, limestone, and volcanic rock were
              essential ingredients to this 50,000-spectator arena, and
              earthquakes and stone thieves tried and failed to tear it down. It
              was not a site for friendly bouts of football and musical concerts —
              gladiators fought for a bloody victory, battles were reenacted, and
              terrifying, exotic animals were put on display. The effort had a
              singular purpose beyond mere spectacle: to provide the crowds with
              entertainment as a means of preventing unrest, which can lead to
              riots and regime change. However, after Rome collapsed, the space
              was converted into housing, workshops, and even religious spaces
              during the medieval eras. Today, over six million people visit it
              each year, and it continues to host exciting exhibitions and shows.

          </div>
          <div class="history-card-content">
            <p>
              The Taj Mahal welcomes an astonishing 35 to 40 thousand visitors
              every day — and with busy seasons, it is no stranger to up to 8
              million visitors annually. The origin of this marbled expression of
              love lies in the celebrated reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan 400
              years ago. This leader had a desire to build a monument to the
              object of his affection and favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Ultimately,
              it exists as a tomb for her, but she is certainly one of the few
              people who will not be forgotten as time goes by. It took 20
              thousand artisans to create this place, with precious jewels and
              marble that are said to gleam pink and white depending on the time
              of day. As a UNESCO World Heritage Site (since 1983), the
              architecture is a celebration of the Mughal style. One fascinating
              choice the designers made was to slightly tilt the four minarets
              (towers) away from the main structure so that in the case of
              disaster, they would not collapse towards the tomb and cause more
              damage. Bear in mind, if you take the pilgrimage there, that the
              complex also hosts a brilliant mosque and a guest house that are
              worthy of appreciation, too.
